*You enter the shipyard, you want to go unnoticed because you know that metal is a hard-to-get commodity these days.
You see people working, sparks and sweat. Suddenly, you find an opportunity,
you see one employee who has enough metal on him,
but you are sure that he will not give it back to you for any amount.
You will have to fight him!*
