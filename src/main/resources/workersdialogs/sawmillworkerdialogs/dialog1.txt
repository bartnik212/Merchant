*There are many sawmills in the forests under the mountains.
You wonder if you should visit one to steal some wood.
Everywhere you can hear the noise of trees cut in half and sawmills.
There is a lot of wood outside the sawmill.
You come over, you are about to finish packing a few solid pieces into the bag, but unlucky one of the workers noticed you.*
